    "In the \"One to many\" associations lab, we used SQLAlchemy to create establish a \"belongs to\" and \"has many\" relationship between our `Actor` and `Role` classes.  Every instance of the Actor class could have many roles, and each instance of the Role class belonged to an Actor.\n",
    "\n",
    "This relationship might not properly mimic the real world, however.  Although Actors do have many Roles, shouldn't a Role also have many Actors?  For instance, the role of James Bond has been played by Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Pierce Brosnan, and Daniel Craig.  In this lab, we will build out this relationship by creating a join table called `actor_roles` containing `actor_id` and `role_id` columns."
